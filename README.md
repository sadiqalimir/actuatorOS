## Project Overview:

Welcome to our Experiential Learning project on designing an Electrical Actuator Operating System for avionics. This project is part of the "Fundamentals of Avionics" course, where we, as aerospace engineering students, aim to develop a microcontroller-based system that controls two electrical actuators with linear extension and retraction in synchronization. The primary objective of this project is to create an efficient and precise control system that can be used in various avionics applications to enhance safety and performance.

## Problem Statement:

The core challenge of our project is to design and implement an Electrical Actuator Extension and Retraction System suitable for avionics. The system must integrate a microcontroller to control two electrical actuators, ensuring they extend linearly for 15 cm and retract 10 cm out of the total 15 cm extension. For practicality and cost-effectiveness, we will select commercially available electrical actuators and components, considering their parameters and compatibility with the overall system. Additionally, we will carefully choose a suitable power supply (battery) and estimate the maximum power consumption during the extension and retraction processes.

## Project Scope:

Our project involves a comprehensive and systematic approach to tackle the various aspects of designing and developing the Electrical Actuator Operating System for avionics. The key components of our project scope include:

1. **Literature Survey:**
   Conduct a thorough review of existing research, technical papers, and relevant literature on electrical actuators, microcontrollers, and their applications in avionics. This will provide us with valuable insights and serve as a foundation for our project.

2. **System Analysis and Specification:**
   Define the requirements and specifications of the Electrical Actuator Operating System based on the application in avionics. Analyze the system's key parameters such as actuator speed, load capacity, power requirements, and precision of control.

3. **Simulink-based Model Development:**
   Create a detailed Simulink-based model to simulate the Electrical Actuator Operating System. This will help us validate the system's behavior, identify potential issues, and optimize its performance before physical implementation.

4. **Component Selection and Hardware Design:**
   Select suitable commercially available electrical actuators, microcontrollers, sensors, and other components based on our system's requirements. Design the hardware layout, including schematics and PCB layouts, to integrate these components effectively.

5. **Control Algorithm Implementation:**
   Develop advanced control algorithms to ensure synchronized and precise linear extension and retraction of the electrical actuators. The algorithms will be fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance while maintaining stability and safety.

6. **Hardware Implementation and Testing:**
   Assemble the hardware components and implement the developed control algorithms. Conduct rigorous testing and calibration to verify the system's functionality and adherence to safety standards.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   Prepare a comprehensive project report detailing the entire development process, methodologies, results, and findings. The documentation will provide a complete understanding of our project to readers.

8. **Presentation and Demonstration:**
   Create an engaging and informative presentation to effectively communicate the project's objectives, progress, and outcomes to our peers, instructors, and other interested parties.
